//to show understanding... it is interesting that if I type tle since warturtle and squirtle share tle you get a morphered version lol

# Part 2
### a)

ggrep -P "(whatever your pattern is)" [whatever your file is])

ggrep -P "beed" firest/filescan_00.1

I could not use the formula so I just found this
grep -o "beed\|blas\|bulb\|butt" forest/filescan_00.1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
This came out as 4

grep -o "beed\|blas\|bulb\|butt" forest/filescan_00.1 | wc -l

I was able to get 146 but that is the number of lines that contain one instance of the words



### b)

grep -o "beed\|blas\|bulb\|butt" forest/filescan_00.1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 3

I got 40 beed, 38 butt, 38 blas
